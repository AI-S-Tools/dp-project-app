==========================

🔗 Task Dependencies:
Dependencies ensure tasks are completed in the correct order.
A task with dependencies cannot start until all dependency tasks are "done".

📋 Creating Tasks with Dependencies:
  # Task that depends on others:
  dppm task create frontend-auth \
    --project web-app \
    --phase frontend \
    --title "Frontend Authentication" \
    --dependency-ids "auth-system,user-api"

📄 Dependency Structure in YAML:
  dependency_ids: ["auth-system", "user-api"]
  blocked_by: []      # Auto-calculated
  blocking: []        # Auto-calculated

🚫 Understanding Blocking:
  • blocked_by: Tasks that must complete before this task can start
  • blocking: Tasks waiting for this task to complete
  • dependency_ids: Explicit dependencies you set

📊 Checking Dependencies:
  dppm status dependencies --project web-app
  dppm status blocked --project web-app
  dppm status project web-app

💡 Example Dependency Chain:
  1. setup-repo (no dependencies) ✅
  2. database-setup (depends on: setup-repo) 🔄
  3. auth-system (depends on: database-setup) ⏳ BLOCKED
  4. frontend-auth (depends on: auth-system) ⏳ BLOCKED

🔧 Dependency Best Practices:
  • Keep dependency chains short (max 3-4 levels)
  • Use phases to group related work
  • Check for circular dependencies
  • Mark tasks "done" promptly to unblock others

⚠️ Troubleshooting:
  # Find what's blocking a task:
  dppm status blocked --project web-app

  # See full dependency chain:
  dppm status dependencies --project web-app

💡 AI Usage Tips:
  • Use status commands to understand project health
  • Check blocked tasks daily to identify bottlenecks
  • Use dependency analysis to plan work order
  • Status output is structured for easy AI parsing

  • dppm wiki "dependencies"       # Dependency management`)
}

func showBlockedTasksGuide() {
	fmt.Println(`Blocked Tasks Resolution Guide
=============================

🚫 Understanding Blocked Tasks:
A task is "blocked" when it has dependencies that are not yet completed.
The task cannot start until ALL dependencies are marked "done".

🔍 Finding Blocked Tasks:
  dppm status blocked --project my-project
  dppm status project my-project    # Shows blocked count

📊 Example Blocked Task Output:
  🚫 Frontend Authentication
     Priority: high
     Blocked by: Backend API, User Database Schema

  This means Frontend Authentication cannot start until both
  "Backend API" AND "User Database Schema" are marked as "done".

✅ Resolving Blocked Tasks:
  1. Identify the blocking tasks
  2. Work on completing the blocking tasks first
  3. Mark blocking tasks as "done" when complete
  4. The blocked task will automatically become "ready to start"

🔧 Updating Task Status:
  dppm task update backend-api --status done
  dppm task update user-schema --status done
  # Now frontend-auth is automatically unblocked!

📈 Monitoring Block Resolution:
  Before:
  🚫 Blocked: 3 tasks
  📋 Ready: 2 tasks

  After completing blocking tasks:
  🚫 Blocked: 1 task
  📋 Ready: 4 tasks

💡 Prevention Strategies:
  • Plan dependencies carefully during task creation
  • Keep dependency chains short (2-3 levels max)
  • Use phases to group related work
  • Complete high-priority blocking tasks first
  • Check status daily to catch blocks early

⚠️ Common Issues:
  • Circular dependencies (Task A blocks B, B blocks A)
  • Long dependency chains (A→B→C→D→E)
  • Missing dependencies (forgot to mark prerequisite)
  • Wrong dependencies (dependency not actually needed)

   📋 Ready: database
   🚫 Blocked: auth-api, login-ui

And so on...

💡 Best Practices:
   • Plan all phases before creating tasks
   • Set up dependency chains thoughtfully
   • Use priority levels to guide work order
   • Check status daily to identify bottlenecks
   • Mark tasks "done" promptly to unblock others

🎯 SCENARIO: Building a Web Application
Let's walk through creating a complete project from scratch.

1️⃣ PROJECT CREATION:
   dppm project create web-app --name "Modern Web App" --owner "ai-team"

2️⃣ PHASE PLANNING:
   dppm phase create setup --project web-app --name "Project Setup"
   dppm phase create backend --project web-app --name "Backend API"
   dppm phase create frontend --project web-app --name "Frontend UI"
   dppm phase create deploy --project web-app --name "Deployment"

3️⃣ TASK CREATION WITH DEPENDENCIES:
   # Setup Phase
   dppm task create git-repo --project web-app --phase setup --title "Git Repository Setup"
   dppm task create docker-env --project web-app --phase setup --title "Docker Environment" --dependency-ids "git-repo"

   # Backend Phase
   dppm task create database --project web-app --phase backend --title "Database Schema" --dependency-ids "docker-env"
   dppm task create auth-api --project web-app --phase backend --title "Authentication API" --dependency-ids "database"
   dppm task create user-api --project web-app --phase backend --title "User Management API" --dependency-ids "auth-api"

   # Frontend Phase
   dppm task create react-setup --project web-app --phase frontend --title "React App Setup" --dependency-ids "auth-api"
   dppm task create login-ui --project web-app --phase frontend --title "Login Interface" --dependency-ids "react-setup"
   dppm task create dashboard --project web-app --phase frontend --title "User Dashboard" --dependency-ids "login-ui,user-api"

   # Deploy Phase
   dppm task create ci-cd --project web-app --phase deploy --title "CI/CD Pipeline" --dependency-ids "dashboard"

4️⃣ EXECUTION WORKFLOW:
   # Check initial status
   dppm status project web-app
   # Output: 1 ready task (git-repo), 7 blocked tasks

   # Start first task
   dppm task update git-repo --status in_progress
   # Work on it...
   dppm task update git-repo --status done

   # Check what's unblocked
   dppm status project web-app
   # Output: 1 ready task (docker-env), 6 blocked tasks

   # Continue the workflow...
   dppm task update docker-env --status in_progress
   dppm task update docker-env --status done

   # Now database becomes ready
   dppm status project web-app

5️⃣ MONITORING THROUGHOUT:
   # Check for any blocking issues
   dppm status blocked --project web-app

   # See full dependency chain
   dppm status dependencies --project web-app

   # List tasks by phase
   dppm list tasks --phase backend

This example shows how DPPM manages complex projects with proper dependencies,
phase organization, and clear workflow progression!`)
}

func showProjectTypesGuide() {
	fmt.Println(`Project Types Guide
==================

DPPM supports two project organization strategies:

🗂️ PHASE-BASED PROJECTS (Recommended)
Best for: Larger projects with distinct development stages

Structure:
  project/
  └── phases/
      ├── phase-1/
      │   └── tasks/
      ├── phase-2/
      │   └── tasks/
      └── phase-3/
          └── tasks/

Benefits:
  ✅ Clear separation of development stages
  ✅ Better overview of project progress
  ✅ Easier to manage large numbers of tasks
  ✅ Natural grouping of related work

Example:
  dppm project create web-app --name "Web Application"
  dppm phase create backend --project web-app
  dppm phase create frontend --project web-app
  dppm task create api --project web-app --phase backend
  dppm task create ui --project web-app --phase frontend

📋 TASK-BASED PROJECTS (Simple)
Best for: Small projects with few tasks

Structure:
  project/
  └── tasks/
      ├── task-1.yaml
      ├── task-2.yaml
      └── task-3.yaml

Benefits:
  ✅ Simple and flat structure
  ✅ Quick to set up
  ✅ Good for maintenance tasks

Example:
  dppm project create bugfixes --name "Bug Fixes"
  dppm task create fix-login --project bugfixes --title "Fix login bug"
  dppm task create fix-api --project bugfixes --title "Fix API error"

💡 CHOOSING THE RIGHT TYPE:
Use Phase-Based When:
  • Project has > 10 tasks
  • Clear development stages exist
  • Multiple people working
  • Long-term project

Use Task-Based When:
  • Project has < 10 tasks
  • Simple maintenance work
  • Quick fixes needed
  • Personal todo list

  • dppm wiki "create phase"      # Phase management
  • dppm wiki "project workflow"  # Complete examples`)
}

func showActiveTasksGuide() {
	fmt.Println(`Active Tasks Guide
=================

📋 FINDING ALL ACTIVE TASKS:

List all in-progress tasks across all projects:
  dppm status active

List active tasks in specific project:
  dppm status active --project web-app

List tasks by status:
  dppm list tasks --project web-app --status in_progress
  dppm list tasks --project web-app --status todo

📊 Example Output:
  Active Tasks (In Progress):
  ==========================

  Project: web-app
  • Authentication API (high priority)
    Phase: backend
    Assignee: john-doe
    Started: 2025-09-23

  • User Interface (medium priority)
    Phase: frontend
    Assignee: jane-smith
    Started: 2025-09-24

💡 MONITORING ACTIVE WORK:

Check who's working on what:
  dppm list tasks --assignee john-doe --status in_progress

Check phase progress:
  dppm list tasks --phase backend --status in_progress

Find overdue active tasks:
  dppm list tasks --status in_progress --overdue

🔧 UPDATING TASK STATUS:

Mark task as in progress:
  dppm task update AUTH-001 --status in_progress

Mark task as completed:
  dppm task update AUTH-001 --status done

⚠️ BEST PRACTICES:
  • Only have 1-2 tasks in_progress per person
  • Update status immediately when starting/stopping work
  • Review active tasks daily
  • Complete tasks before starting new ones

🔍 Related Commands:
  • dppm wiki "status commands"   # All status options
  • dppm wiki "task workflow"     # Task lifecycle`)
}

func showActivePhasesGuide() {
	fmt.Println(`Active Phases Guide
==================

📅 UNDERSTANDING PHASE STATUS:

Phase Status Values:
  • planning   - Phase being designed
  • active     - Currently working on this phase
  • completed  - Phase finished
  • cancelled  - Phase abandoned

📋 FINDING ACTIVE PHASES:

List all phases in a project:
  dppm list phases --project web-app

List only active phases:
  dppm list phases --project web-app --status active

Check phase details:
  dppm phase show backend --project web-app

📊 Example Phase Listing:
  Phases for project: web-app
  ==========================

  ✅ Phase: setup (completed)
     Tasks: 3/3 completed
     Duration: 2025-09-01 to 2025-09-07

  🔄 Phase: backend (active)
     Tasks: 5/8 completed, 2 in progress, 1 blocked
     Duration: 2025-09-08 to 2025-09-22

  📋 Phase: frontend (planning)
     Tasks: 0/5 completed
     Duration: 2025-09-23 to 2025-10-07

🔧 MANAGING PHASE TRANSITIONS:

Activate a phase:
  dppm phase update backend --project web-app --status active

Complete a phase:
  dppm phase update backend --project web-app --status completed

💡 PHASE WORKFLOW:
  1. Create phase in "planning" status
  2. Add all tasks to the phase
  3. Set phase to "active" when ready to start
  4. Work through tasks in dependency order
  5. Mark phase "completed" when all tasks done

⚠️ BEST PRACTICES:
  • Only one phase should be "active" at a time
  • Complete phases before starting new ones
  • Use phases to group related work
  • Plan all phases at project start

🔍 Related Commands:
  • dppm wiki "create phase"      # Phase creation
  • dppm wiki "phase workflow"    # Phase management`)
}

func showDependencyOrderGuide() {
	fmt.Println(`Dependency Order Guide
=====================

🔗 UNDERSTANDING DEPENDENCY ORDER:

Tasks must be completed in dependency order:
  1. Tasks with no dependencies (can start immediately)
  2. Tasks depending only on completed tasks
  3. Tasks with unmet dependencies (blocked)

📋 VIEWING DEPENDENCY ORDER:

Show dependency chain for project:
  dppm status dependencies --project web-app

Show tasks in workable order:
  dppm status project web-app
  # Shows: Ready tasks → Blocked tasks

📊 Example Dependency Chain:
  Dependency Order for web-app:
  ============================

  Level 1 (No dependencies):
  ✅ repo-setup (done)
  ✅ documentation (done)

  Level 2 (Depends on Level 1):
  ✅ docker-env (done) → depends on: repo-setup
  🔄 api-docs (in_progress) → depends on: documentation

  Level 3 (Depends on Level 2):
  📋 database (ready) → depends on: docker-env
  🚫 api-tests (blocked) → depends on: api-docs

  Level 4 (Depends on Level 3):
  🚫 auth-api (blocked) → depends on: database
  🚫 user-api (blocked) → depends on: database

🎯 FINDING NEXT TASK TO WORK ON:

Show ready tasks (no blocking dependencies):
  dppm status project web-app
  # Lists "Ready to Work On" section

Show blocked tasks and their blockers:
  dppm status blocked --project web-app

💡 DEPENDENCY BEST PRACTICES:

Good Dependencies:
  • auth-api depends on database (logical)
  • frontend depends on api (necessary)
  • deploy depends on tests (safe)

Bad Dependencies:
  • Circular: A→B→C→A (impossible)
  • Too deep: A→B→C→D→E→F (bottleneck)
  • Unnecessary: UI→Database (can work parallel)

🔧 MANAGING DEPENDENCIES:

Add dependency to existing task:
  dppm task update frontend --dependency-ids "api,auth"

Remove dependency:
  dppm task update frontend --dependency-ids ""

⚠️ TIPS:
  • Keep chains shallow (max 3-4 levels)
  • Allow parallel work where possible
  • Check for bottlenecks regularly
  • Complete blocking tasks first
