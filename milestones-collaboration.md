# Milestones Extension - AI Collaboration Plan

This document uses DPPM's AI collaboration system to coordinate the implementation of the milestones extension.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation

::LARS:1::
Task: milestone-core-system
DPPM Context: High priority task in milestones-extension phase
Implement basic milestone.go with CRUD operations
- Create milestone struct and YAML schema
- Implement create, read, update, delete operations
- Set up Dropbox storage in projects/PROJECT/milestones/
- Add basic CLI commands (create, show, list, update)
Deliverable: Working milestone commands with YAML persistence
::

::GEMINI:2::
Prerequisites: Task 1 completed
Task: milestone-integration
Design integration points with existing system
- Analyze current project.yaml, phase.yaml, task.yaml structures
- Design milestone reference extensions
- Plan backward compatibility approach
- Create migration strategy for existing projects
Deliverable: Integration specification document
::

### Phase 2: Dependencies and Relationships

::LARS:3::
Prerequisites: Tasks 1, 2 completed
Task: milestone-dependencies
Implement milestone dependency system
- Create dependency resolution algorithms
- Add phase → milestone relationships
- Add task → milestone relationships
- Implement blocking/blocked-by logic
- Add dependency validation (circular detection)
Deliverable: Working dependency system with validation
::

::GEMINI:4::
Prerequisites: Task 3 completed
Task: milestone-progress-tracking
Design progress calculation and reporting
- Create progress calculation algorithms
- Design milestone dashboard layouts
- Plan completion prediction logic
- Design status reporting formats
Deliverable: Progress tracking specification and UI mockups
::

### Phase 3: User Experience

::LARS:5::
Prerequisites: Tasks 3, 4 completed
Implement progress tracking system
- Build progress calculation engine
- Create milestone dashboard commands
- Add completion prediction based on velocity
- Implement milestone status reporting
Deliverable: Working progress tracking with predictions
::

::GEMINI:6::
Prerequisites: Task 5 completed
Task: milestone-wiki-integration
Create comprehensive milestone documentation
- Write milestone management guide
- Create milestone planning tutorial
- Document dependency management
- Add AI collaboration examples with milestones
Deliverable: Complete milestone documentation in wiki
::

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

::LARS:7::
Prerequisites: Tasks 1-6 completed
Task: milestone-advanced-features
Implement advanced milestone capabilities
- Create milestone templates for common patterns
- Add stakeholder notification system
- Integrate with AI collaboration system
- Add basic Gantt chart generation
Deliverable: Production-ready advanced features
::

## Quality Checkpoints

::GEMINI:8::
Prerequisites: All core tasks (1-5) completed
Quality assurance and testing
- Test all milestone commands
- Verify dependency resolution
- Test progress calculations
- Validate YAML schema integrity
- Check AI collaboration integration
Deliverable: QA report and test results
::

## Documentation and Deployment

::LARS:9::
Prerequisites: Tasks 7, 8 completed
Final integration and release preparation
- Update main DPPM help documentation
- Add milestone examples to startup guide
- Test migration of existing projects
- Prepare release notes
Deliverable: Release-ready milestone extension
::

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All milestone commands work correctly
- [ ] Dependencies resolve properly without circular references
- [ ] Progress tracking accurately reflects milestone status
- [ ] Integration with existing projects works seamlessly
- [ ] AI collaboration system supports milestone context
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation available
- [ ] All tests pass

## Timeline Estimate

Based on implementation complexity:
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 weeks (Foundation)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks (Dependencies)
- **Phase 3**: 2 weeks (User Experience)
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 weeks (Advanced Features)

**Total Estimated Time**: 7-10 weeks for complete implementation

## Ready for AI Coordination
