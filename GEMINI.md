## Project Overview

**DPPM - Dropbox Project Manager v1.1.0** is an AI-first CLI tool for project, phase, and task management using Dropbox as the storage backend. Perfect for AI-driven development workflows with verbose, AI-friendly output and local project binding.

### DPPM Project Tracking

This project is actively managed using DPPM itself. Current project status:

## Build and Development

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Build the application
go build -o dppm

# Test basic functionality
./dppm --version
./dppm list projects
./dppm status project dp-project-app

# Format code
gofmt -w *.go

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy
```

### Project Structure

This is a Go-based CLI application using:
- `github.com/spf13/cobra` for CLI commands
- `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` for YAML parsing
- Standard library for file handling

**Key Files:**
- `main.go`: CLI entry point and root command
- `project.go`: Project CRUD operations
- `task.go`: Task management with dependencies
- `sprint.go`: Phase management (legacy naming)
- `status.go`: Status reporting across all levels
- `wiki.go`: Built-in knowledge base system
- `init.go`: Complete project initialization workflow

### Data Storage

All data is stored as YAML files in:
```
~/Dropbox/project-management/projects/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dp-project-app/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ phases/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core-development/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-collaboration/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ enhancements/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bug-fixes/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ milestones-extension/
```

## AI Development Guidelines

### When Working with DPPM Code

1. **Check Project Status First**: Always run `dppm status project dp-project-app` to understand current priorities
2. **Update Task Status**: When working on tasks, update their status in DPPM using `dppm task update`
3. **Follow Patterns**: Study existing commands in `project.go`, `task.go` etc. for consistent patterns
4. **Test with Real Data**: Build locally and test with actual DPPM projects
5. **AI-Friendly Output**: All commands should provide verbose, helpful output for AI workflows

### Common Development Patterns

```go
// Standard command structure
var createProjectCmd = &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "create PROJECT_ID",
    Short: "Create a new project",
    Long:  `Detailed description with examples...`,
    Args:  cobra.ExactArgs(1),
    Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
        // Implementation with error handling
        // Verbose success/failure messages
    },
}
```

### Testing Approach

```bash
# Build test binary
go build -o dppm-test

# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Many commands are broken! See issues #20-31

# Test with DPPM project management
./dppm-test status project dp-project-app  # ‚úÖ Works
./dppm-test task create new-feature --project dp-project-app --phase core-development  # ‚úÖ Works

# Test local binding functionality (new in v1.1.0)
go build -o dppm-test-local
./dppm-test-local bind dp-project-app  # ‚ö†Ô∏è Auto-scoping broken (Issue #21)
./dppm-test-local status project dp-project-app  # ‚ùå Still requires --project flag

# Always test help systems and wiki
./dppm-test --help  # ‚úÖ Works
./dppm-test wiki "getting started"  # ‚úÖ Works
./dppm-test wiki list  # ‚úÖ Works

# Test comprehensive expectations (available in docs/test/)
# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: See docs/test/expectation.yaml - Only 13% test success rate!
# See docs/test/wiki.md for all wiki texts and help content
```

## Release Process

**‚ö†Ô∏è RELEASE v1.1.1 CANCELLED DUE TO CRITICAL BUGS**

When bugs are fixed, releases are automated via GitHub Actions:
- Tag format: `v1.0.0`
- Multi-platform binaries: Linux, macOS, Windows (amd64, arm64)
- Homebrew tap: `AI-S-Tools/dp-project-app`

**DO NOT CREATE ANY RELEASE TAGS UNTIL ALL 12 ISSUES ARE RESOLVED!**

## Integration with MCP (High Priority)

The project includes active development of MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration to enable seamless AI assistant access to project data. This will allow real-time project context sharing with AI development tools.

**Current Status:** Designed and ready for implementation as high priority task.

- **Test Results (2025-09-24):**
  - **6 tests passing** (13%)
  - **27 tests failing** (60%)
  - **12 GitHub issues created** for critical bugs

- **Features:** DSL markers, collaboration detection, wiki integration
- **Commands:**
  - `dppm collab find` - ‚úÖ Works
  - `dppm collab wiki` - ‚úÖ Works
  - `dppm collab clean` - ‚ùå **BROKEN** (Issue #28)

## Contributing Guidelines

**‚ö†Ô∏è PRIORITY: FIX THE 12 CRITICAL BUGS BEFORE ANY NEW DEVELOPMENT**

1. **Fix Bugs First**: Address GitHub issues #20-31 before new features
2. **Test Everything**: Run comprehensive tests from `docs/test/expectation.yaml`
3. **Follow Go Patterns**: Consistent with existing cobra command structure
4. **AI-First Design**: All features should enhance AI development workflows
5. **Comprehensive Help**: Every command needs detailed help and examples
6. **YAML-Based Storage**: Maintain the Dropbox-synchronized YAML approach

**Critical Test Commands Before Any PR:**
```bash
# These MUST work without errors:
./dppm-test init test-project --skip-github
./dppm-test bind test-project
./dppm-test list active
./dppm-test status active
./dppm-test list phases
./dppm-test collab clean
```
